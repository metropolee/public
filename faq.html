			<h3>Questions & Answers</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt id="faq1">I am not a tech expert, will I be able to build an app with Metropolee?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Absolutely! That's why we built Metropolee. We wanted everyone to be able to create applications. We also offer learning paths if you want to earn a certificate and become a Metropolee Consultant.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq2">What are the technical requirements to use your systems?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Our Mobile Application Builder is a web-based software and works with all modern browsers. You need an internet connection to use the MAB and all other Metropolee services. For an optimal use, we recommend at least 5 Mbps of bandwidth. Our courses are streamed over the internet, which means you need a stable connection to have a fluid experience.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq3">What features are included in the Setup Kits?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>See the full list of the features included with each kit in <a href="http://metropolee.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/sales/metropolee-features-list.pdf" title="Metropolee Feature List" target="_blank">this document</a>.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq4">If I buy a Setup Kit, how long will it take for you to build my application?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>It depends on the quality of the information we are provided with. If we have all the information needed to build the app, it will generally take a couple of days for us to start the submission to the stores. Google Play usually approves apps within a few hours, while Apple can take a week or more.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq5">What information is needed to create the app?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Providing quality information ensures a timely and quality delivery. This should give you a hint:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Business contact data like address, email, phone number, website.</li>
						<li>Company logo and colors.</li>
						<li>A company description of about 500 words.</li>
						<li>All other information related to specific features like images, discount details, promotions, product catalog.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For the full list of features and requirements, we have prepared a pdf to be printed out and filled-in for those who prefer working with paper. <a href="http://metropolee.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/sales/metropolee-features-selection-form.pdf" title="Metropolee Feature requirements list" target="_blank">Download it here</a>.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq6">Do you offer a refund?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Yes, we do. You can ask for a full refund within 14 days of payment receipt.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq7">I have chosen to pay via wire transfer. Where can I find the bank account details to make the payment?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The details are emailed to you once you click on Pay via Wire Transfer on the payment page during signup. By the way, you can make the payment to:</p>
					<p><i>
						Metropolee Technologies International ltd<br />
						Bond House, 27-30 Merchants Quay<br />
						Dublin Dublin Dublin8<br />
						Ireland</i>
					</p>
					<p><i>

						BIC/SWIFT: BOFIIE2D<br />

					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq8">How do I set up an autoship?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>If you are a distributor, the autoship ensures you are active in the binary and receive commissions. You will also have two applications active in your MAB account, a demo and a normal one. To set up an autoship, simply <a href="http://metropolee.com/members/default.asp" title="Log into your back office">log into your back office</a>. In your back office homepage, on the bottom right, you have the autoship pane. Click on Edit Autoship, select the Autoship from the dropdown in the center and click on Add item. That's it, the autoship is set and will be billed once a month. If you want us to process the autoship immediately, please contact support.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq9">What payment method do you use for commission withdrawals?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Payouts are made via Neteller. Neteller is one of the most trusted payment services online. You will be able to transfer funds to your personal bank account and request payment cards to access your funds immediately. You are required to open a Neteller account using the same email address you signed up with. We do not process payouts via wire transfer at this stage.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq10">When will you credit my commissions to my wallet?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Commissions are calculated every Monday for the week before and are credited to your account three weeks in arrear. This means that if you score a sale today, the relative commissions will appear in your earnings next Monday and will be credited to your wallet in three Mondays from now.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq11">I have a Neteller account. How long does it take for the withdrawal to be credited in my Neteller account?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Withdrawal requests are approved on Fridays and credited to Neteller on Mondays. This means that if you ask for a payout on a Saturday, your request is approved the following Friday and credited on Monday.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq12">How do I become a Metropolee Certified Consultant and what does this mean to me?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>As a Certified Consultant you will be eligible to perform the setups requested by Metropolee's clients and earn the related Consultant Bonus, even for clients you didn't sponsor yourself.</p>
					<p>To become a Certified Consultant you will have to go through a series of lessons and quizzes to prove your knowledge. If you pass the tests, you will be admitted to Metropolee's Live Exams.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq13">What is the live examination to become a Metropolee Certified Consultant? How do I get into it? What are the challenges involved?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The live exam is the last hurdle you need to overcome to become a Certified Consultant. You get access to live exams by completing all lessons and quizzes for a specific module (Bronze, Silver, Gold). You will be required to put what you learned into practice by building an app according to a set of requests that mirror real-case scenarios from clients. This way, we know you are trained to build applications for real clients.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq14">Is it mandatory to take the courses and get the Certification? Am I somewhat penalised for not being a Certified Consultant?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Absolutely not! You can be a distributor and enjoy tremendous success with Metropolee without ever touching the MAB. The learning paths are for those who enjoy building applications and are looking for a career in the tech industry.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq15">The tests and exams are too difficult for me. Why don't you make them easier?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Our clients – your clients – want to have amazing apps that bring real value and increase revenue. We set a pretty high standard for ourselves because we know that our clients have high expectations. We test you thoroughly because your clients will do the same and we need to make sure you can cope with that and deliver the excellent results that Metropolee guarantees. Would you want to be operated by a surgeon that had easy tests in his learning career? I bet not. Your clients neither.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq16">I bought a Gold Member Kit. I want to become a Metropolee Gold Certified Consultant. Do I have to complete also the Bronze and Silver courses?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Yes. Learning paths are incremental. The Bronze course covers the basic features included in the Bronze Setup Kit. The Silver has more advanced content and also provides the basics of photo editing for better graphics in the apps. With the Gold course you will master the top-selling features and obtain other important skills that will help you excel in Metropolee.</p>
					<a href="#questions" class="to-top">Top</a>
				</dd>
				<dt id="faq17">Is there a contract that the client should print and sign?</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>When signing up, the client will accept the Terms & Conditions. That is everything that's needed. The client is then free to print the Terms & Conditions for his reference, but that is not required.</p>
